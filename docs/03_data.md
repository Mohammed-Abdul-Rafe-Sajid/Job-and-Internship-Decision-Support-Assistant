## External Data Source

To ground the chatbot in real-world information, a curated CSV dataset
containing job roles, required skills, salary ranges, and growth outlooks
was introduced.

This dataset serves as a lightweight knowledge base that the assistant
can retrieve from when providing career guidance, enabling fact-based
reasoning rather than purely generative advice.
