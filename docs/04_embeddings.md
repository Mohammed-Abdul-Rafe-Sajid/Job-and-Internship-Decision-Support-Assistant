## Embeddings

Each job role from the CSV dataset is converted into a descriptive
natural-language text and embedded using Azure OpenAI’s embedding model.

These embeddings allow the chatbot to retrieve semantically relevant
career information based on user queries, forming the basis of a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.
