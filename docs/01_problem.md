## Defining Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to build an AI-powered decision support assistant that helps users reason through job and internship choices in a transparent and explainable manner. Rather than giving absolute answers, the assistant evaluates trade-offs, highlights risks, and makes conditional recommendations based on available information.

#### Target Users

- The primary target users are:

- Final-year undergraduate or postgraduate students

- Fresh graduates exploring entry-level roles

- Early-career professionals evaluating internships or role switches


These users often face high-stakes decisions with limited mentorship, making structured guidance particularly valuable.

#### Why This Problem Was Chosen

This problem was chosen because it reflects a real and common challenge faced by students, including the author of this project. It is well-suited to an AI-driven solution, as large language models can assist with reasoning and explanation when grounded in reliable external data.
